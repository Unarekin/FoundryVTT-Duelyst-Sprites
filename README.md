## Actor Creator
Included with the module is an Actor Creator macro, to make setting up actors using these sprites as quick and simple as possible.

Simply select a "preset" (The unit from Duelyst), an actor type, and give it a name and optionally a folder in which to create the actor, and it will create one for you.

It will also preconfigure settings for both [Theatre Inserts](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/theatre) and [Sprite Animations](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sprite-animations)
